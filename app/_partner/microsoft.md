This task will create a basemap of the area in order to help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and prepare for mobile data collection and field mapping in the areas."

  desc: "The Red Cross is mapping the Ayeyarwady Delta area in Myanmar as part of a multi-year mapping and data readiness activity to better understand where critical infrastructure and roads are to inform decision making during potential disasters. As recently as 2008 a cyclone killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless. The map data will help the Red Cross to better understand where people live in relation to potential hazards so that we can help them be prepared for the disaster and so national decision makers can make better decisions in the immediate aftermath of a disaster."

  desc: "Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region, the American Red Cross is working with Red Cross partners in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean to address local hazards and vulnerabilities in dozens of disaster-prone communities.  This initiative began with a Red Cross-led assessment process in which communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters. The American Red Cross is also helping strengthen the capacity of Red Cross partners in the region to deliver services to communities.  There is currently very little data for the area and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making."
