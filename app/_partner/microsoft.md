The project also aims to enhance community disaster preparedness by sustaining and expanding initiatives focused on organizing, connecting, and building the capacity of community members, raising awareness through existing community radio programs, and implementing school-based disaster risk reduction activities."

  desc: "Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region. After the tracing the Red Cross GIS team will travel to some of these locations to train local staff and volunteers how to capture GIS data using the OpenStreetMap platform. There is currently very little data for these areas and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making."
