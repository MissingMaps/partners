    desc: "Large-scale epidemics and pandemics pose a serious threat not only to global health security but also to countries, communities and individuals in their efforts to achieve resilience. Epidemics and pandemics affect all sectors, impacting routine health services, economic and food security, trade, education, civil order, communication, transportation, and many other areas of life. The threat of emerging infectious diseases, including those of zoonotic origin, and the increasing prevalence of diseases previously controlled by antimicrobials and vaccination efforts, is a cause for concern to the global health community. Communities play an important role in prevention, early detection and early response with regard to this threat."
