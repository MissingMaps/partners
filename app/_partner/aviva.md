    desc: "The British Red Cross is mapping the Kurigram District in Bangladesh as part of a Vulnerability to Resilence (V2R) project. The V2R project was designed to replicate and build on a successful resilience program implemented by Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDCRS) to implement disaster risk reduction activities to enhance resilience to future floods. A midline survey is about to be conducted across 30 communities. Data will be used to measure change throughout, and at the end of, the project. The project aims to improve health as a consequence of accessing safe and sustainable water and improve hygiene and sanitation practices."

    desc: "The British Red Cross is mapping Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city in Far-Western Nepal as part of the Strengthening Urban Resilience and Engagement (“SURE”) programme. The SURE programme builds on a programme implemented by the Nepal Red Cross (NRCS) from 2012 to 2015 to help the Kathmandu valley prepare for an earthquake, expanding to work in seven municipalities across three of Nepal’s major urban centres. A mobile phone-based survey is about to be undertaken including in Dhangadhi. Data will be used to measure change throughout and at the end of the programme. In addition, as part of urban assessments, this data will be used to create hazard maps with citizens and vulnerable communities."

    desc: "The Forecast-based Financing (FbF) project in Peru, by the Red Cross Climate Centre, intends to support the vulnerable people of the Amazonas flood plain exposed to severe floods. Given the high risk of water vector-borne diseases and damage to houses, the Peruvian Red Cross with the support of the German Red Cross are developing a FbF mechanism, based on forecast information, to support families in a timely manner to conduct mitigation and preparedness actions to minimize these risks due to their vulnerability and exposure to floods. Exposure data is still a challenge, as existing maps do not show clearly where households are located, therefore having a map of the existing communities, will help us to analyse the extend of potential affectation based on historical data and it will allow us to prioritize in a more effective way the most exposed and vulnerable households."
