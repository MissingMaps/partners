    desc: "MSF is launching a new maternal and child health support program in the health district of Moissala in Chad. The first activity will be a community survey to appreciate more in detail the health conditions of women and children. The mapping will help MSF to have an overview of all households (represented by roofs) and draw a sample of the population to carry out the survey. The data will also help in better programming health activities."
