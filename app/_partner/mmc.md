    desc: "Large-scale epidemics and pandemics pose a serious threat not only to global health security but also to countries, communities and individuals in their efforts to achieve resilience. Epidemics and pandemics affect all sectors, impacting routine health services, economic and food security, trade, education, civil order, communication, transportation, and many other areas of life. The threat of emerging infectious diseases, including those of zoonotic origin, and the increasing prevalence of diseases previously controlled by antimicrobials and vaccination efforts, is a cause for concern to the global health community. Communities play an important role in prevention, early detection and early response with regard to this threat. The American Red Cross is supporting the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) with a new program focusing on open data advocacy, community mapping, and integrating data into data driven decision-making. Communities, in their understanding of local environments and social customs, play an important role in prevention, early detection and early response with regard to this threat. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur."
