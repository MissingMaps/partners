    desc: "Isle de Jean Charles (known locally in Louisiana French as Isle Ã  Jean Charles) is a narrow ridge of land situated in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. For over 170 years it has been the historical homeland and burial ground of the state-recognized tribe of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians. Residents of the Island have long been threatened by Louisiana's coastal erosion (coastal Louisiana loses a landmass the size of Manhattan every year). The Island, which consisted of over 22,000 acres of land in 1955, has lost about 98% of its land since due to saltwater intrusion, subsidence, and sea level rise.[2] In January 2016, the state of Louisiana received substantial funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to fund the tribe's resettlement to safer ground."
