  desc: "Mugumu is the capital of Serengeti district in eastern Tanzania and the surrounding villages have a very high incidence of Female Genital Mutilation, early marriage and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better road and residential area data to facilitate their outreach work. We need to complete this map by mid November so we can print out paper maps ready for the next FGM cutting season in December."
