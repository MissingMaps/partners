The V2R project was designed to replicate and build on a successful resilience program implemented by Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDCRS) to implement disaster risk reduction activities to enhance resilience to future floods. A midline survey is about to be conducted across 30 communities. Data will be used to measure change throughout, and at the end of, the project. The project aims to improve health as a consequence of accessing safe and sustainable water and improve hygiene and sanitation practices."
