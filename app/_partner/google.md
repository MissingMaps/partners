MSF also organises mobile clinics, which respond to the needs of people affected by violence, insecurity and poor access to healthcare, some of whom have have been forced to flee their homes. Mapping this area will help MSF to identify vulnerable populations, plan and manage medical interventions and provide better care for those displaced by violence."
