    desc: "In the lake basin region of Chad, the influx of the displaced population is exerting pressure over scarce essential resources. This has resulted in a sharp increase of humanitarian needs in food, healthcare and water, hygiene and sanitation for both IDPs and host communities. Moreover, around 780 unaccompanied children require protection, psychosocial support and recreational activities."

    desc: "The Red Cross is mapping the Ayeyarwady Delta area in Myanmar as part of a multi-year mapping and data readiness activity to better understand where critical infrastructure and roads are to inform decision making during potential disasters. As recently as 2008 a cyclone killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless. The map data will help the Red Cross to better understand where people live in relation to potential hazards so that we can help them be prepared for the disaster and so national decision makers can make better decisions in the immediate aftermath of a disaster."
