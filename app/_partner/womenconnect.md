    desc: "This project is led by CARE and CartONG and aims to map unsafe or high-risk places of gender-based violence in the city of Jérémie. This mapping will be done initially in a participatory approach that will - in several stages - determine the causes, frequency, severity and consequences of insecurity in the city of Jérémie in order to address later tracks improvement to the authorities. This mapping by and for the local population can then be valued by the actors of security and justice of the city as well as the local population on a larger scale."

    desc: "Peru has a very unequal society, and whilst parts of Peru are well mapped, these tend to be urban, wealthy areas that reflect the inter-sectional power relations at play in the country. GAL School Peru is training local high school students in Cusco to identify under-represented social issues, and then investigate, map and share them. To date, groups of school girls in Cusco have created campaigns that use maps of sexist publicity and behavior, presenting them as part of an international festival and to local government representatives, as well as peers and the broader school community. GAL will train 150 youth in mapping gendered issues, and work with local mayors in the Cusco region to better understand the experiences of girls in society."

    desc: "Tanzania has a very high incidence of Female Genital Mutilation, extreme poverty, early marriage and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better maps to facilitate their outreach work and protect girls at risk of FGM. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur."
