    desc: "The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the U.S. Government initiative to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS around the world. PEPFAR requests assistance to inventory buildings and roads for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs. This task focuses attention on Shinyanga, Tanzania. Understanding where communities are located and how they are connected by roads is essential to understanding whether HIV/AIDS services are in the right place. The data that emerge from this mapping task will support our understanding of program coverage, the optimization of supply chain logistics, and the analysis of clinical site-level data."
