    desc: "Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region Red Cross GIS team members will be traveling to some of these locations to train local staff and volunteers how to capture GIS data using the OpenStreetMap platform. There is currently very little data for these areas and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making."
