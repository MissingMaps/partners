    desc: "Tanzania has a very high incidence of Female Genital Mutilation, extreme poverty, early marriage and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better maps to facilitate their outreach work and protect girls at risk of FGM. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur."

    desc: "MSF was in Somalia in 1991 – 1992 and then continuous from 1997 until 2013 before the decision to pull MSF out of Somalia due to the deteriorating security conditions. In 2016, MSF decided on a model of re-entry into Somalia where a single MSF-Somalia mission coordination team based in Nairobi visit projects sites during short in and out visits. MSF-Somalia began activities during May 2017 in Mudug Regional Hospital (MRH), Galkayo North, in Somalia’s Puntland region, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. The first activity was supporting the therapeutic feeding program, followed by OPD paediatrics and IPD paediatrics in June 2017. Now MSF-Somalia is supporting with stabilization in the emergency room, TB OPD & IPD services and MSF supported Ministry of Health mobile clinic outreach activities. The mobile clinics provide weekly outpatient consultation, immunization, nutrition screening and referrals, in each of the 23 refugee camps in Galkayo North. For security reasons MSF teams are limited to the hospital site, limiting regular contact with the community as well as the ability to implement non-GIS based sampling methods. Using GIS methods and your help, we would like to map households in each of the 23 IDP camps in MSF’s catchment in order to implement a representative survey across the population. The planned survey is a comprehensive mixed method study to determine the most urgent health, nutrition and humanitarian needs for programming and more efficient use of resources. The results of the survey will be used in the overall strategy of MSF-Somalia programs in North Galkayo and for advocating on behalf of the population, and lobby where needed with other actors. The survey is planned to take place during December 2018."
