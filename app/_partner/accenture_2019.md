  desc: Tanzania has a very high incidence of Female Genital Mutilation, extreme poverty, early marriage and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better maps to facilitate their outreach work and protect girls at risk of FGM. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

  desc: "Although Thailand has made significant progress in reaching the government's goal of Malaria elimination by 2024, cases are still persistent in the border regions. By tracing structures you will help those on the ground to better understand settlement patterns, estimate the number of households in a village, target interventions, and better plan for control operations."
