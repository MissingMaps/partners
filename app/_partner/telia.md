    desc: "The Red Cross is mapping the Ayeyarwady Delta area in Myanmar as part of a multi-year mapping and data readiness activity to better understand where critical infrastructure and roads are to inform decision making during potential disasters. As recently as 2008 a cyclone killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless. The map data will help the Red Cross to better understand where people live in relation to potential hazards so that we can help them be prepared for the disaster and so national decision makers can make better decisions in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur."

    desc: "Large-scale epidemics and pandemics pose a serious threat not only to global health security but also to countries, communities and individuals in their efforts to achieve resilience. Epidemics and pandemics affect all sectors, impacting routine health services, economic and food security, trade, education, civil order, communication, transportation, and many other areas of life. The threat of emerging infectious diseases, including those of zoonotic origin, and the increasing prevalence of diseases previously controlled by antimicrobials and vaccination efforts, is a cause for concern to the global health community. Communities play an important role in prevention, early detection and early response with regard to this threat. The American Red Cross is supporting the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) with a new program focusing on open data advocacy, community mapping, and integrating data into data driven decision-making. Communities, in their understanding of local environments and social customs, play an important role in prevention, early detection and early response with regard to this threat.

It is largely populated by Kurds but has minority populations of Turkmens, Arabs, and Assyrians. Mapping accurately this area will support an improved data collection system and city mapping in Iraq. Moreover, it will help to get OSM project further known locally."

    desc: "With the Public Health Section of UNHCR (PHS), CartONG continue the large-scale deployment of the WASH KAP survey with a training missions of UNHCR Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Managers and implementing partners in charge of managing the refugee camps of Smara in West Algeria. This camp is part of a group of refugee camps around Tindouf, which have been hosting refugees from Western Sahara for several years. The goals of the training is, first of all, to learn how to adapt the standardized WASH KAP surveys to local settings, to also learn how to deploy it in the field, and lastly to teach them how to use the analysis tools which come with it. Mapping the camp will help organize the survey and will be useful in planning camp management in the long run."
