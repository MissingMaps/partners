    desc: "BUILDINGS ONLY mapping, no need to map the roads. An escalation of violence in South Sudan since July 2016 has lead to a large population movement into the north of neighboring Uganda. An estimated rate of between 2,000 and 3,000 displaced persons cross the border into Uganda each day. In a rapidly developing situation such as this, it is vital that accurate and up-to-date mapping information is available to allow the UNHCR and partners to respond to needs more effectively and efficiently."

We believe in the need to be prepared for the recovery and response to any natural disasters and unpredictable socio-structural changes that may have negative consequences. Earthquakes and then floods are the main disasters that take place in Turkey. We believe it is important to start working from now on mapping and updating the maps continuously. As of 2016, Bagcilar has a population of 751510, inhabiting 22 Mahalles (neighbourhoods), and the population density is 34,409 per km2. The area of Bagcilar district is 21,84 KM2. It is estimated that there were around 37,643 registered Syrian refugees in the district, according to research was conducted by Migration Policy Workshop (MAGA) operating within Marmara Municipalities Union’s Center for Urban Policies"

    desc: "BUILDINGS ONLY mapping, no need to map the roads. The steady stream of refugees from South Sudan continues to fill the overflowing settlements in Northern Uganda, and UNHCR planners are desperately trying to provide for those already in, as well as create new environments for those in-coming. As violence escalates in neighbouring Congo, Planners are finding themselves outflanked from the west, as incoming numbers increase by land and lake. Mapping an area before refugees are settled is vital, to see how much time and resources are needed to prepare these new environments. These areas are unknown, and remote mapping enables HOT field surveyors to get into the field and survey for detail on Water, Sanitation, Construction /Shelter-building and other resources. The map will be something that will unify the different interventions, ensuring that the right people get the right help in the right place."
