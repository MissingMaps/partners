    desc: "This project supports efforts to eliminate malaria and other interventions. Your mapping contribution will help prevent the suffering and loss of life this disease causes! Although Thailand has made significant progress in reaching the government's goal of Malaria elimination by 2024, cases are still persistent in the border regions. By tracing structures you will help those on the ground to better understand settlement patterns, estimate the number of households in a village, target interventions, and better plan for control operations."

    desc: "The Red Cross is mapping the Ayeyarwady Delta area in Myanmar as part of a multi-year mapping and data readiness activity to better understand where critical infrastructure and roads are to inform decision making during potential disasters. As recently as 2008 a cyclone killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless. The map data will help the Red Cross to better understand where people live in relation to potential hazards so that we can help them be prepared for the disaster and so national decision makers can make better decisions in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur."

    desc: "In the lake basin region of Chad, the influx of the displaced population is exerting pressure over scarce essential resources. This has resulted in a sharp increase of humanitarian needs in food, healthcare and water, hygiene and sanitation for both IDPs and host communities. Moreover, around 780 unaccompanied children require protection, psychosocial support and recreational activities. This is due to increased conflict in South-Western Diffa region of Niger which is part of the lake Chad basin. The humanitarian crisis in the region bordering Northern Nigeria is enormous. More than 8 million people across the three states of North East Nigeria most affected by insecurity - Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, require humanitarian assistance. Of the estimated 1.8 million IDPs, nearly 80 per cent of them live with host communities, placing a huge strain on infrastructure and resources in an already poor region."
