    desc: "BUILDINGS ONLY mapping, no need to map the roads. An escalation of violence in South Sudan since July 2016 has lead to a large population movement into the north of neighboring Uganda. An estimated rate of between 2,000 and 3,000 displaced persons cross the border into Uganda each day. In a rapidly developing situation such as this, it is vital that accurate and up-to-date mapping information is available to allow the UNHCR and partners to respond to needs more effectively and efficiently."

We believe in the need to be prepared for the recovery and response to any natural disasters and unpredictable socio-structural changes that may have negative consequences. Earthquakes and then floods are the main disasters that take place in Turkey. We believe it is important to start working from now on mapping and updating the maps continuously. As of 2016, Bagcilar has a population of 751510, inhabiting 22 Mahalles (neighbourhoods), and the population density is 34,409 per km2. The area of Bagcilar district is 21,84 KM2.

    desc: "BUILDINGS ONLY mapping, no need to map the roads. In South Sudan, the current repositioning of armed forces is creating expectations that currently displaced numbers of 3 million will swell to 7.5 million in 2018. There are 500,000 in refugee situations just across the border from Northern Uganda. Meanwhile, refugee influx from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) into areas in Western and Southern Uganda now exceeds South Sudanese, numbering over 200,000 total and 10,000 already this year (in the month of January). Emergency planners across this region ‘are really suffering’ in the struggle to keep up with these numbers. Because of the mapping already started here partners UNHCR have asked HOT to swiftly resource-map the areas which need new settlements. Mapping an area before refugees are settled is vital, to see how much time and resources are needed to prepare these new environments. This rural district is unknown, and remote mapping enables HOT field surveyors to get onto the ground and survey for detail on Water, Sanitation, Construction/Shelter-building and other resources. The map will be something that will unify the different interventions, ensuring that the right people get the right help in the right place."

    desc: "Please map buildings and roads. This project is to review, update and complete the basemap (buildings and roads) in Ggaaba Parish, Kampala City. Ggaba Parish was chosen as a potential use-case for improving baseline OSM information through geospatial data collection. This data could then be used by KCCA and other partners for DRR assessments, surveys, and analysis using the OSM platform. From interviews with KCCA and ground visits led by HOT and MapUganda, it was determined that a significant amount of change in terms of land use and development have occurred in Ggaba Parish. Whereas many of the buildings and roads have been mapped, there remains some which are not mapped with the availability of newer imagery. Your mapping contribution will help better prepare Kampala City to respond to disasters."
